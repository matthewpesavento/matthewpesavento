### [The impact of direct to consumer shipping laws on the number and size distribution of U.S. wineries](https://doi.org/10.1017/jwe.2022.49)

#### Abstract: 
#### The changing legislative landscape of the U.S. wine market provides a scenario to examine the effect of regulation on the size distribution of firms. Using the variation across states and time in the sum of in-state and out-of-state adult populations between 2002â€“2017, and a difference in difference-style empirical model, I examine how restrictions on Direct to Consumer (DTC) sales impact the number of establishments and the employment at wineries. I find that the expansion of the potential wine market by 10 M adults caused about a 3.5% increase in the number of wineries. While reduced DTC restrictions explain growth in the number of wineries, I find no effect of lessened restrictions on the number of winery employees, though there is evidence of a lagged effect. Additionally, I find that the growth of smaller wineries substantially outpaces that of larger wineries when regulations are lessened. These results suggest that regulatory barriers in particular industries may allow states to maintain an artificial size distribution.

(Working Paper) **Household Economic Consequences of Type II Diabetes Diagnosis: Evidence from Marginal Diagnosis**

Abstract:
In this paper, I exploit the recommendation of the American Diabetes Association's diagnosis criteria for Type II Diabetes in an Regression Discontinuity Design to understand the marginal effect of Type II Diabetes on household financial distress, and on labor supply. To answer these questions, I merge patient data from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center with Experian consumer credit data, and with Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services. To my knowledge, this is the first paper that seeks to understand financial distress and labor supply in a causal way using administrative credit and patient records. Moreover, this paper analyzes the extent to which patients may use householding as a financial coping mechanism, and/or as a buffer against changes in labor supply.



(Working Paper) **The impact of household cancer diagnosis on investment in higher education, labor supply, and financial distress**

*This research was supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation through a research grant awarded to the National Bureau of Economic Research*

Abstract: 
The onset of a costly medical condition affects not only the individual with the disease but also creates a shock to household finances that may affect labor and human capital investment decisions of other household members. Using a unique dataset comprised of Experian consumer credit information matched to administrative data from the state of Ohio, I aim to assess inter-generational effects of household medical disease, with particular focus on changes in college dropout rates, pre-mature entry into the labor force, and financial distress, by comparing outcomes of students without a household cancer diagnosis to outcomes of students with a household cancer diagnosis. I also explore heterogeneity in the results with pre-diagnosis financial and labor supply characteristics of the household. The dataset matches consumer credit information from Experian with administrative data from the state of Ohio on students and their household members enrolled in public universities, and on wage and unemployment claims. I also match to the state cancer registry for the state of Ohio. Results from this study contribute to the growing literature on the financial distress that results from medical disease, which connects household finance with health economics. The results may assist policymakers understand mechanisms for dropout and determine strategies to mitigate situations where pre-mature entry into the labor force results in lower human capital and increased student loan debt.



(Working Paper) **An assessment of the relationship between a chronic illness in a child and the labor market behavior and financial health of the household members** with Ross Maltz and Stephanie Moulton

Abstract:
Chronic illness can be extraordinarily financially costly and time burdensome. Estimates of the financial burden that patients incur to treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are more than 2x the burden that individuals without the disease incur annually, especially for young patients. Between daily disease management, and the time required for frequent medical appointments, the estimated time cost to treat IBD range from about 1.5 to 3 hours per day. These two demands -- financial burden and time obligations -- motivate different behaviors. Financial burdens alone suggest an increased attachment to the labor force, while time obligations may suggest decreased attachment. In this paper, we try to understand the effect that the onset of chronic illness in children has on the parents' labor force participation and financial distress. To answer this question, we connect records from Nationwide Children's Hosptial in Ohio with Experian consumer records, and with labor force data from the State of Ohio. Ultimately we seek to better understand this trade-off that families might be making when a child is diagnosed with a chronic and debilitating illness.
