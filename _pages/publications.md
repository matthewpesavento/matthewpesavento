## Under Review

### [How are retail prices formed in restructed electricity markets? with Dormady, Roa-Henriquez, Hoyt, Koenig, Welch, and Li](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4918037)

#### A key challenge in obtaining efficient and competitive retail rates in restructured electricity markets is constructing an appropriate default generation price. Default prices in restructured states are often set by competitive procurement auctions in which firms bid to supply a fixed percentage (i.e., tranches) of a utility’s full-requirements load obligation (supply, capacity, ancillary services, and sometimes transmission). Auction clearing prices serve as a price heuristic for other competitive retail supply offers on the open market. Default service also substitutes for competitive retail supply for customers that cannot or will not shop. The efficiency and competitiveness of these auctions, therefore, is of societal importance. In this paper, regression analysis is performed on a unique ten-year dataset of wholesale, retail, and input market parameters for Ohio’s four investor-owned utilities to evaluate factors that influence its auction results.

## Working Papers

### (Dissertation) [The effects of type II diabetes on financial distress and labor supply: evidence from administrative data](https://matthewpesavento.github.io/files/Pesavento_Dissertation_Diabetes.pdf)

#### In this paper, I exploit the recommendation of the American Diabetes Association's diagnosis criteria for Type II Diabetes in an Regression Discontinuity Design to understand the marginal effect of Type II Diabetes on household financial distress, and on labor supply. To answer these questions, I merge patient data from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center with Experian consumer credit data, and with Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services. To my knowledge, this is the first paper that seeks to understand financial distress and labor supply in a causal way using administrative credit and patient records. Moreover, this paper analyzes the extent to which patients may use householding as a financial coping mechanism, and/or as a buffer against changes in labor supply.

### (Dissertation) [The impact of household cancer diagnosis on investment in higher education](https://matthewpesavento.github.io/files/Pesavento_Dissertation_CancerHEI.pdf)

##### *This research was supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation through a research grant awarded to the National Bureau of Economic Research*

#### The onset of a costly medical condition affects not only the individual with the disease but also creates a shock to household finances that may affect labor and human capital investment decisions of other household members. Using a unique dataset comprised of Experian consumer credit information matched to administrative data from the state of Ohio, I aim to assess inter-generational effects of household medical disease, with particular focus on changes in college dropout rates, by comparing outcomes of students without a household cancer diagnosis to outcomes of students with a household cancer diagnosis. The dataset matches consumer credit information from Experian with administrative data from the state of Ohio on students and their household members enrolled in public universities. I also match to the state cancer registry for the state of Ohio.

### (Dissertation) [The impact of household cancer diagnosis on labor supply of young adults](https://matthewpesavento.github.io/files/Pesavento_Dissertation_CancerHEI.pdf)

##### *This research was supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation through a research grant awarded to the National Bureau of Economic Research*

#### It is increasingly documented that the emotional, financial, and employment strain of medical disease (and particularly cancer) can be as great or greater for caregivers as it is for the patient himself. While a growing literature seeks to understand the labor impacts of medical disease on spouses or adult children, very little research exists that examines the impact that chronic medical disease has on early labor force engagement of young adults. I match the cancer registry from the state of Ohio with wages from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, and use a stacked difference in difference event study approach to study the impact that household cancer diagnosis has on labor outcomes of young adults.

## In Preparation
### An assessment of the relationship between a chronic illness in a child and the labor market behavior and financial health of the household members with Ross Maltz and Stephanie Moulton

#### Chronic illness can be extraordinarily financially costly and time burdensome. Estimates of the financial burden that patients incur to treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are more than 2x the burden that individuals without the disease incur annually, especially for young patients. Between daily disease management, and the time required for frequent medical appointments, the estimated time cost to treat IBD range from about 1.5 to 3 hours per day. These two demands -- financial burden and time obligations -- motivate different behaviors. Financial burdens alone suggest an increased attachment to the labor force, while time obligations may suggest decreased attachment. In this paper, we try to understand the effect that the onset of chronic illness in children has on the parents' labor force participation and financial distress. To answer this question, we connect records from Nationwide Children's Hosptial in Ohio with Experian consumer records, and with labor force data from the State of Ohio. Ultimately we seek to better understand this trade-off that families might be making when a child is diagnosed with a chronic and debilitating illness.
